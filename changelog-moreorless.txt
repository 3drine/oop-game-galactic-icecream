8:00 AM 8/12/2023
	added logic to decrease by one for same objects for chocolate 
8:13 AM 8/12/2023
	implemented count logic with vanilla and strawberry using a switch function but goes negative - need to stop at 0;

8:30 AM 8/12/2023
	added game over logic based on poop collision
8:36 AM 8/12/2023
	need to move the moving function to individual elements, otherwise, stacked element keeps falling 
8:41 AM 8/12/2023
	moved the moving function on the obstacle createDomElement and stored the interval in this.movement
8:46 AM 8/12/2023
	icecream balls can be stored in player dom element stopped the moving by clearing interval this.movement 11:04 AM 8/12/2023
	need to store the balls in an object too 
11:12 AM 8/12/2023
	created array for storing balls in player class player.stackedBalls
11:15 AM 8/12/2023
	created CSS class 'stacked' to mark objects that need to be stacked on top of the player 
11:19 AM 8/12/2023
	really need to fix the ratios and clean pixel perfect the balls - not use percentage anymore
11:26 AM 8/12/2023
	focussing on X axis first 
11:44 AM 8/12/2023
	replaced all obstacles with px values 
11:50 AM 8/12/2023
	replaced player with pixel values. Checking collision.... 
11:53 AM 8/12/2023
	collision still working :) :) :) 
11:54 AM 8/12/2023
	need dynamic height on the player object for stacking
12:03 PM 8/12/2023
	got growing logic working , can work on stacking inside - will lock dedicated space for icecream cone later 
10:41 AM 8/14/2023
	what makes the object stop moving? clearInterval(obstacleInstance.movement) 
11:00 AM 8/14/2023
	created new function in player class 'stackItem' to stack items in stackedBalls property and manipulate dom
11:07 AM 8/14/2023
	managed to edit x value of object in the stackItem function to stack in the middle
11:07 AM 8/14/2023
	now working on y.... 
11:41 AM 8/14/2023
	managed to properly stack by ammending y property of the stacked dom element 
11:55 AM 8/14/2023
	fixed hitbox to only first 20px - ignored below
11:57 AM 8/14/2023
	adjusted player's height to have more space for design later on 
12:11 PM 8/14/2023
	added weight to player by decreasing speed on the function stackItem - for now a floor of 2 seems like a good value 
12:12 PM 8/14/2023
	added gravity parameter on obstacle class 
12:19 PM 8/14/2023
	added gravity logic, gravity of 2 seems like a good value for now
12:34 PM 8/14/2023
	Problem: obstacle that hits the hitbox also has the time to hit the players' non-hitbox area... solved by using the hit variable as false condition for the side collision detection 
12:35 PM 8/14/2023
	added new function in game class 'detectSideCollision'
12:36 PM 8/14/2023
	now will work on the spinning feature using transform rotate on obstacle 
12:39 PM 8/14/2023
	added status param on obstacle class 
2:19 PM 8/14/2023
	seems like I can do the spinning without js 
2:23 PM 8/14/2023
	got spinning working with css animation + keyframe deifinition
2:34 PM 8/14/2023
	added antigravity item logic (player weighs nothing for a bit) 
2:50 PM 8/14/2023
	added slowtime item logic - logic works but not sure about the gravity values. Had to move gravity on the game class to make it a dynamic value for the obstacle 
3:05 PM 8/14/2023
	slowtime doesnt time out 
	careful if you pick 2 special items after each other for restoring original value 
3:11 PM 8/14/2023
	fixed the antigravity item (player moves slower) by adding a boolean param on the player for antigravity, if he already has it on, will do nothing 
3:22 PM 8/14/2023
	fixed the slowTime() function 
3:29 PM 8/14/2023
	added cherry to the stackable items 
3:29 PM 8/14/2023

	added level html to screen on the right of the board 
4:39 PM 8/14/2023
	added 3 divs start / board / end and class 'active/inactive'
5:57 PM 8/14/2023
	changing the class active/inactive bcs it's annoying and not optimal 
6:15 PM 8/14/2023
	fixed directly in the CSS value - START screen will start with a display; table cell (for now) and gamescreen + endscreen will start with display none 
6:25 PM 8/14/2023
	added all screens to an array with path and preferred display mode - as you turn they on / off- you don't want always display: block for ALL screens 
6:32 PM 8/14/2023
	added a super cool function showScreen - just add your screen there and it will update all other screens to display:none and change the chosen screen to the favorite defined display 
6:40 PM 8/14/2023
	added 'next screen' for separate layout from the 'start screen' 
6:50 PM 8/14/2023
	added flow for automatically nagivating between the screens 
6:52 PM 8/14/2023
	moved new player initiating in the start() function instead of in the construction for logical purposes - need to keep the same game on for leveling 
6:53 PM 8/14/2023
	game is not starting after clicking on NEXT 
6:57 PM 8/14/2023
	yaaay it works now - I moved the 'game' variable in the global scope :) now NEW GAME on start button but FUNCTION START on next button
